## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
This is collaborative project to create a real world front end application by showcasing skills we have acquired. The project aims to solve real world problems with intuitive user experience and meaningful information.
​
### User Story
​
```
AS AN health consious event goer
I WANT to search an event for multiple cities and find out that cities COVID situation
SO THAT I can plan going to events accordingly
```
​
### Acceptance Criteria
​
```
GIVEN an Event-COVID tracker with user inputs
WHEN I search for an event, location, and/or distance from my current location
THEN I am presented with events at that location
WHEN I view searched events
THEN I am presented with event's name, date and an option to see COVID information
WHEN I view COVID information
THEN I am presented with cases and admitted patients in the last week including % of fully vaccinated people and population of that county
WHEN I click on an event

​
## Our process
​
### Built with
​
- Ticket Master API
- COVID Act Now API
- JQuery
- MD Bootstrap
​
### What we learned
​
We learned how to effectively work in a team by collaborative problem solving, initiative to finish tasks, and managing conflicts.  It is a new experience working on a code alongside others and separating tasks and having multiple perspectives aided in the completion of this project.

We were able to learn how to work on a single project collaboratively with GitHub. GitHub's assisted with merging and resolving conflicts between each of our codes. 

We also learned how to implement another kind of CSS framework. There are several frameworks that we can use depending on the type and functionality of the project. Based on our needs for this application, MD Bootstrap was the most efficient. 

We learned more about collecting data from server side API's and how to call information with different parameters.
​
### Continued development
​
We aim to implement the skills we learned from this project to real world applications. The skills we learned to effectively collaborate and manage conflicts will be useful to future team projects. Although not all teams will be alike and that there will be novel experiences with different teams, there is something to take away from that experience and it is important to continue learning.
